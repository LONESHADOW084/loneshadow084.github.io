                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Hello there. My name is Keanu Bainbridge, I was born in Shiprock, NM and raised in No Water Mesa, AZ. This here is a portfolio to show off my skills to create a website along with learning new techniques along the way.</p>

                <strong><small>I take photographs every now and then. Sometimes they are like the image below.</small></strong>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/Windmill.jpeg" alt="Red Mesa Windmill" width="400" height="200">

                </figure>
                <p>There are some things that I like to do to pass the time. But one of those things are when I take photos and try to get a good one. Sometimes most of them don't end up like how I want them and sometimes there are those that look great. One reason why I'd learn more about coding is to create an application so that the photos I've taken can become much more better

                    <h1>Becoming a Software Engineer</h1>
                    <strong><small>There are a lot of reasons why I want to become a Software Engineer. Many of those things will be in the list below.</small></strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Developing Apps, Software, and Programs</li>
                        <li>Skills are transferable towards different other career options.</li>
                        <li>There are so many unbelievable projects that can be created with a single programming language, let alone many others.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>There were a lot of things that I wanted to be way before I thought of coming here to Coding Temple. I wanted to become a Video Game Developer, then a Cybersecurity Analyst, until I eventually settled in on being a Software Engineer. 
                       From what I've come up with on research, all tech jobs are pretty much the same thing. They know the same information but focus their skills on other aspects of what they want to become.
