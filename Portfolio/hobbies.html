        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <strong><small>Heres the page that tells what I like to do sometimes, every now and then.</small></strong>
        <p>Out of everything there is, I have a couple favorites to do during my free time or if I have the resources to do so.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Paracording</strong>: I make a lot of bracelets, bag holders, lanyards, etc. I sell most at my local flea market on the weekends, but some say that I price them too high. But each to their own,
                        gas is expensive. Especially when my only form of electricity is running on a generator.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Art</strong>: I mostly do digital art, since it's more easier and there's more variety in the types of brushes that can be used. My common art that I do is planets, but with more practice as time goes on, I'll finally be able to draw
                concept art of my sketchbook drawings in their detailed glory. Such as arts like this:</li><img src="images/Legacy.JPG" width="250" height="400">
            <li><strong>Woodworking</strong>: There's a lot of small woodworking projects that I've made over the years. From puzzles to step stools. My best one was building a paracord jig that can change sizes from bracelet size to rifle strap size.</li>
            <li><strong>Gaming</strong>: I'm an advid gamer, I've played most games on various platforms. From console to PC gaming, it's all there. My favorite so far are physics-related games such as Teardown. There are others but I don't want to delve too 
                        deep down the rabbit hole of video games.</li>
            <li><strong>Reading/Writing</strong>: I absolutely <em>love</em> to read. My favorite genres are from <q>Action</q>, <q>Dystopian</q>, <q>Futuristic</q>. These are my top three that I like to read. It's mostly series that I like to read like the Halo books, Dead Space books and comics, and published books that originally came from the online website <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/">Wattpad</a>. I am currently in the process of writing my own book as well too. It's called Legacy, read it <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/story/190832925-legacy">here</a>.
                        It's currently ongoing but I still update every now and then. I have a lot more of short stories within the Legacy universe but one thing to complete first before moving onto the next project.</li> 
        </ol>
        <p>And so there is all my hobbies. There are still things that I'd like to try out and see how they go. Just like paracording, I just wanted to try that out and see what I can make <em>if</em>  I could make anything, and so I did make a lot of things. Now thats something I can make during my free time. I hope to learn more so I can create my own website to sell them to customers.
            That and sell my woodworking projects as well. This has been my description of hobbies that I have. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3Z7zEc7AXQ"><button>Thank you for reading</button></a></p>
